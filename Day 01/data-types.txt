Data types are fundamental building blocks in Python programming. They define the type of value a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on that value. Understanding data types is essential for writing effective and efficient Python code.



Numeric Types:

1. int (integer): Represents whole numbers, positive, negative, or zero. (42, -100, 0)

2. float (floating-point): Represents numbers with decimals. (3.14, -9.25e+2)

3. complex: Represents complex numbers with a real and imaginary part. ( 3+5j, 1j)



String Type:

4. str: Represents sequences of characters. Used for text data. ("Hello, world!", 'Python')


Collection Types:

5. list: An ordered, changeable collection of items. Elements can be of different data types. ([1, "apple", 3.4])

6. tuple: An ordered, immutable collection of items. Elements can be of different data types. ((2, "banana", True))

7. set: An unordered collection of unique items. ({1, "orange", "orange"})

8. dictionary (dict): An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys are unique and immutable, while values can be any data type. ({"name": "Alice", "age": 30})



Other Built-in Types:

9. bool (boolean): Represents logical values: True or False.

10. bytes: Represents a sequence of bytes (used for binary data).

11. bytearray: A mutable version of bytes.

12. None: Represents the absence of a value.

Explanation:

input("What is your name? "): This line uses the input() function. Inside the parentheses, you can provide a message (prompt) that will be displayed to the user asking for their input. In this case, it asks "What is your name? ".

name = ...: The user's input is stored in the variable you specify. Here, we're using name to store the entered name.

print(f"Hello, {name}!"): This line uses an f-string (formatted string literal) to greet the user by name. The f"..." allows you to embed variables directly within the string using curly braces {}. In this case, {name} will be replaced with the value stored in the name variable.

Important Note:

The input() function always returns the user's input as a string, even if they enter a number. If you need to work with numerical data, you'll need to convert the input to the appropriate data type (e.g., integer or float) using conversion functions like int() or float().

Here's an example of how to handle numerical input:

Python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
Use code with caution.

This code converts the user's input (which will be a string) to an integer using int() before using it in calculations or printing.
